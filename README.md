âŠ¹â‚Šâ‹† You can call me Kat :-)

âŠ¹â‚Šâ‹† I'm not really active as much on PT as I used to be, but I still get on everyone once in a while to either be with friends or hang out

âŠ¹â‚Šâ‹† If you're trying to talk to me, pls pls pls whisper it!! There's a good chance I'm either offtab or not paying attention, and I usually have the main chat closed anyways

âŠ¹â‚Šâ‹† I'm really into The Office as of right now, but I also like The Groupchat, Batman, Guardians of the Galaxy, Night in the Woods, Stranger Things, and I occasionally dabble in Ace Attorney. If you're dressed as any ponies from these fandoms pls int with me!!! Especially The Office fans... ough..... Jam for life btw.... ;-)

âŠ¹â‚Šâ‹† Basic dni but also if you're a tcc and/or Zero Day fan. Yes they're both equally bad in my opinion, and no I do not make exceptions. Also, if you're weird about anyone in The Groupchat, pls don't talk to me :sob: looking at YOUUU TGCTWT

âŠ¹â‚Šâ‹† Used to be that person who was obsessed with Kingsman and Elton John... would it be weird to say I don't really like either that much anymore ðŸ˜…

âŠ¹â‚Šâ‹† Okay, that's all. I really really really really REALLY really love Jam. Jammer for life. Okay? Okay
